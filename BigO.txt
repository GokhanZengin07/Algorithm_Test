Algorithm 1
O(1) or Constant time
The item we are searching for will be the first or last element in the list
Best case: O (1) 
Worst case: O(1) 


Algorithm 2
The item we are searching for could be anywhere within the list
Best case: O (1) first item checked
Worst case: O(n) or linear

O(1) or constant time
O(log(n)) or logarithmic time
O(n) or linear time
O(n2) or exponential time
O(n!) or factorial time


---Linear Search---
no assumption - O(n) time

---Binear Search / Divide and Conquer---
sorted assumption - O(log(n)) time
